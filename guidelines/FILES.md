# Guidelines on Writing Code

It doesn't matter what code you're writing, **always** (unless it's YAML) use tabs for indentation. Using spaces breaks flexibility (although some code editors can conveniently manipulate indentation in an entire file) for multiple people to view the same file with their own desired tab width.

If you use 2 spaces as indentation in your code, for instance, that means everyone, even those who hate spaces for indentation to begin with, are forced to see your code with 2 space indentation. If you were to use tabs, however, anyone can make their code editor display the tabs at a certain width they are comfortable with.

Give your code a concise yet descriptive introductory comment at the beginning of the file. Such a comment should usually include what you're looking at, where to find more information and URLs to places where you can see either the source code or more information.
